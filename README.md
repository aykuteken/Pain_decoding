# Explainable fNIRS Based Pain Decoding Under Pharmacological Conditions via Deep Transfer Learning Approach 


In this project, we attempted to decode the pain from a previously collected dataset (Peng et al., 2018, Front. Hum. Neuro.) under different analgesic conditions (Morphine & Placebo) by using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Deep Transfer Learning approaches.

Our objective was to show that deep transfer learning can be used to decode the pain when a drug administration is both available and not available. First, we developed a pain decoding model before drug administration (pre-drug model) and we transferred the knowledge developed in pre-drug model to decode the pain after drug administration (post-drug models).
